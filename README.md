# A Project with 4 Deaths: Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto

## Disclaimer:
First and foremost, I owe the information presented here to the research I conducted in January 2023. The results of my research go beyond mere theory. The reason for this is that the research was not carried out by an ordinary individual, but by a hacker. For nearly 10 years, I have been deeply involved in software, hacking, cryptology, and privacy. I apologize for the delay in writing this article. With that said, let’s begin.

---

## What is Intelligence and How is it Conducted?

If we are to undertake this task, it is clear that precise calculations and logical conclusions will be necessary. Therefore, I will begin by explaining in simple terms and using examples to guide the discussion. This explanation will serve as an initial approach to understanding who the person behind the nickname "Satoshi Nakamoto" might be, or how we can go about finding him.

- Satoshi Nakamoto couldn’t have been born in 2024 or 2010, as it would be illogical for someone born in those years to have published a white paper on October 31, 2008. See how we’ve already used logical reasoning to narrow the scope of our investigation and move closer to the target?

Much like the syllogism:
- "(1) All humans are mortal. (2) Socrates is mortal. Conclusion: Socrates is human."

I ask that you evaluate all the information you are about to learn within this same framework of logical reasoning.

When I began my research in 2023, the first place I looked was the bitcoin.pdf file. The reason I focused on this PDF was not its content, but whether the metadata contained information that would be significant to me. So, what is metadata?

Metadata refers to data about a digital file—whether it’s an image or a text document—rather than the content itself. It provides information about the file, not the object it represents. For example, take a look at the image below: on the left is the cat, and on the right are details about the cat. Similarly, the first thing I examined in relation to Bitcoin was the metadata of its white paper PDF. Upon reviewing this metadata, four details caught my attention, which I will now explain in order.

- The keyboard language used by the person who created this PDF is "en-GB."

- They are using Apache OpenOffice! The reason for not using Microsoft Office may be that Satoshi could have been utilizing macOS or GNU/Linux instead of the Windows operating system while writing the white paper. Of course, this is merely a theory.

- The time zone is "GMT-6." Cities in the GMT-6 time zone include: Chicago, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Guatemala, Houston, Indiana [West], Manitoba, Memphis, New Orleans, Mexico City, Ontario N.W., San Antonio, Texas, Saskatchewan East, St. Louis, and Winnipeg. (GMT-6) Central Standard Time.

Having discussed three steps, let’s now address the fourth step, which is the most critical point.

- "Create Date: 2009:03:24 11:33:15-06:00"

- The Bitcoin white paper is the original thesis written under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto on "October 31, 2008," which established the foundational structure of the Bitcoin network.

Although Bitcoin was published on August 31, 2008, the create date appears to have changed for some reason. (If anyone finds the original PDF, please email me.)

Note: Whether Satoshi intentionally altered this date or if it was simply a minor issue remains to be determined. This is something we can investigate further in detail later.

---

After examining the PDF, the second detail that caught my attention was Satoshi's email address and the fact that he uses "PGP" (Pretty Good Privacy): "satoshin@gmx.com". The fact that he uses PGP created a sense of camaraderie, as if I could consider him a colleague. Was he simply trying to conceal his identity, or was he already a hacker?

Alright, let's move on to the list of possible identities and continue with our discussion.

---

## Possible Identities

- Hal Finney (Harold Thomas Finney II) 1956-2014
- hal.finney@gmail.com

I don't want to provide an extensive explanation regarding the potential identities, as there are many candidates, and most of them don't even fit within my logical framework. I only want to discuss why Hal Finney is not a possible identity.

If you have no idea about the potential identities, you can take a look at the page below.

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto
```

When I first started my research, I must admit that in the initial hours, I also fell into the misconception that Hal Finney was the real Satoshi Nakamoto because you want to believe that such a person could indeed be Satoshi. He was involved in cryptography, passed away in 2014, and his blog is quite comprehensive on the subject. However, the first indication that he is not Satoshi lies in the contradiction of his tweet that stated "running bitcoin."

This tweet is not consistent with the behavior one would expect from someone like Satoshi Nakamoto. Given Satoshi’s obsession with privacy, it would be unreasonable to think that he could make such a glaring logical error by entering Twitter and tweeting in a way that reveals his name and photo. Additionally, please refer to the topic below.

```
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.msg1643833
```

This is precisely the moment when Hal Finney is eliminated from the list of potential identities.

It is indeed a sad situation that Hal Finney passed away in 2014 due to ALS. However, this death in 2014 is related to the fourth of the four deaths mentioned in our title.

Now, let's move on to the third death.

It is quite absurd that there is no mention of Ulf Möller, who was referenced in so many PDFs and email archives and made significant contributions to the cypherpunk community, especially considering he was murdered in 2012. Ulf is not a potential identity, but rest assured, he is a more logical identity than many others.

- Ulf Möller or Ulf Moeller 1972–2012
- 3umoelle@informatik.uni-hamburg.de - mail@ulfm.de

https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/mixmaster-spec.txt (Internet-Draft - Ulf Moeller Expires: December 31, 2003)
```

Before we move on to our main identity, specifically before discussing the second death, I would like to talk about the first death.

Janis Jagars was a friend of Len Sassaman, the individual we will discuss shortly, and you can read the piece Len wrote after Janis's passing.

From: Len Sassaman <rabbi@abditum.com>
Subject: Obituary for Janis Jagars (Disastry) 

Janis Jagars, known to many people on the Internet by his handle Disastry,
was a prolific programmer who made numerous valuable contributions to the
Internet. I am afraid I cannot do his memory justice, having known him
only a short number of years and only through his work on privacy
enhancing programs, but he earned my respect and appreciation for his
achievements in that area.

I first "met" Janis Jagars while I was employed by PGP Security. In
preparation for the release of PGP 7, I located and contacted the people
responsible for other implementations of OpenPGP, in order to set up
interop testing. Janis was working on updating the DOS-aware PGP 2.6.3i
program to work with modern implementations of PGP. His work on that
program, and his presence in the IETF OpenPGP working group, helped to
smooth over a number of PGP compatibility problems. On the PGP newsgroups
and mailing lists, Janis helped many new PGP users get started using email
encryption, and tirelessly answered support questions for privacy-related
programs. To my knowledge, Janis operated the only anonymous remailer to
exist in Latvia.

Janis was, by the original definition, a true Cypherpunk. He believed that
privacy was a right that must not be denied to Internet users, and he
wrote code to help ensure that it could not be.

When he needed a way to easily send encrypted email through Netscape, he
wrote a plugin. When he wanted a way to mount PGPdisk volumes under Linux,
he wrote a conversion tool. When Windows users wanted a pre-compiled
version GnuPG, Janis gave them one. Janis understood that the fight for
Internet privacy must take place at the hands of programmers, and he rose
to the challenge of bring useful privacy-enhancing programs into
existence, and into the hands of the public.

Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September, 2001, I took over
maintenance of the Mixmaster anonymous remailer project. Mixmaster had
been unmaintained for over a year, and needed serious work. I was
delighted when I received email from Janis, offering his help. Over the
next year, entirely of his own initiative, Janis ported Mixmaster's server
functionality to Windows, brought Mixmaster's OpenPGP support from an
unstable "alpha" state to a solid, usable feature set, and established
himself as an invaluable member of the Mixmaster development team. The
upcoming Mixmaster 3.0 release features a number of crucial improvements
which would not have happened had it not been for Janis's involvement.

My last communication with Janis was on October 11th of last year. He had
planned a vacation in Nepal, and expected to return a month later. When he
did not return, we feared the worst. Sadly, it turns out that our fears
were true: On October 31, while descending from Lobuche summit, Janis fell
250m, and did not survive.

I am dedicating this year's CodeCon conference to Janis's memory. Janis
will be missed, but his contributions will still be appreciated and
utilized. It is my hope that Janis's work will serve as an example for
other like-minded programmers, who chose to give their time and code in
the name of free speech and privacy.

## Yes, the time has come to talk about the real Satoshi Nakamoto.

- Leonard Harris Sassaman (aka rabbi) 1980-2011
- rabbi@quickie.net - lsassama@thehill.org - len.sassaman@esat.kuleuven.be - rabbi@abditum.com
- AIM: Elom777 - ICQ: 10735603

I don't want to go into detail about Len Sassaman's interests, so you can learn about them from the links below:

```
https://len.sassaman.net/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Sassaman
```

Please continue reading after reviewing the article and the texts below.

https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10
```

I do want to mention that the people Len Sassaman was connected with are also well-known figures globally. For example:

- Meredith L. Patterson
- Sergey Bratus
- Bart Preneel
- David Chaum
- Dan Kaminsky
- George Danezis
- Bram Cohen
- Nick Mathewson

Among those listed are Len's friends, spouse, and mentors, all of whom are truly one of a kind. However, there is one person who particularly catches my attention, and that is Sergey Bratus.

### Sergey Bratus LinkedIn:
```
Dartmouth College Distinguished Professor in Cyber Security, Technology, and Society; Associate Professor of Computer Science; Former PM at DARPA I2O (2018-24) [Opinions do not represent any part of the US Government]
```

Sergey's knowledge and capabilities truly surpass those of others. The mere presence of individuals like Sergey alongside someone like Len is enough to suggest that Len could indeed be Satoshi.

Len had very strong connections with Sergey, and despite Len's passing, his wife Meredith continues to maintain her relationship with Sergey.

Anyway, let's return to our topic and shift our focus to Len and his friend Disastry, also known as Janis Jagars.

```https://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/```

- In January 2012 we lost Ulf Möller, our friend and main advisor.
- In July 2011 we lost a dear friend, developer and project leader Len Sassaman aka rabbi.
- On October 31st 2002 we lost a dear friend and developer: Janis Jagars aka Disastry. Read Len's Obituary for Disastry.

The page below contains the January 2009 archive, and if you notice, there are names such as Len Sassaman, Satoshi Nakamoto, Peter Gutmann, Hal Finney, and Ivan Krstić. These are not the types of people you would encounter in everyday life.

```
https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/thread.html
```

Additionally, in the article titled "MD5 Considered Harmful Today" on the same page, Len Sassaman begins by referencing Hal Finney.

```
https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014989.html
```

I want you to understand this: in the past, the number of people working in fields like software development, cybersecurity, and cryptography was limited. We need to recognize that well-known individuals genuinely collaborated with each other and referred to one another. For example, I recall reading on Hal Finney's blog how he admired Wei Dai's work. I've also seen many instances of our potential identities collaborating with one another, which I have shared with you.

If we’ve understood this topic, let’s proceed.

When I conducted a deep dive into Len Sassaman's email addresses and usernames, I discovered his old social media accounts and photos. I thoroughly examined all of the photos and found evidence that could be considered significant. Let’s review and analyze these accounts step by step.

Here are the nicknames I found associated with Len Sassaman:

- rabbi
- lsassama
- enochsmiles
- panoptishard
- enochdreams

And here are the social media accounts I accessed:

# Beyond theory, this is the FIRST PIECE OF EVIDENCE!

While browsing through Len Sassaman's social media account, I came across a photo that, for me, makes him Satoshi.

The photo below is dated April 19, 2007, and Len Sassaman shared it on his social media account after taking a picture of a newspaper.

The problem is that Satoshi Nakamoto signed and embedded a quote from a newspaper into the Genesis Block.

- First Photo: On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the #Bitcoin📷 Genesis Block ⛏️
- *(Newspaper: The Times - UK)*

- Second Photo: On April 19, 2007, Satoshi Nakamoto posts a photo he took with his own hand on his blog
- *(Newspaper: Financial Times - UK)*

```
I actually shared this last year. (https://x.com/0xGyg3s/status/1670797381024055299)
```

#### Satoshi Nakamoto announced Bitcoin through a headline related to a "newspaper" rather than a song lyric or a book quote. This newspaper is The Times - UK. Additionally, Len Sassaman shared a photo of a Financial Times - UK newspaper on social media in 2007, about a year and a half before Bitcoin was announced. This constitutes a significant piece of evidence and finding that could be enough to suggest he is Satoshi.

# Let’s move on to the second piece of evidence:

- While researching the email address of **Disastry**, also known as Janis Jagars, I noticed something interesting. Within the source code of a website called Senshi, Disastry's email address was written as a comment. This comment is not visible on the page but appears when you press **Ctrl + U**.

- The name **Senshi** immediately reminded me of **Satoshi**, which caught my attention significantly.

- As I delved deeper into **Senshi**, I realized that it could potentially be either **Len Sassaman or Janis Jagars**. I focused my research in this direction. While I am convinced that **Satoshi** is definitely **Len Sassaman**, the true owner of the name **Senshi** remains uncertain for me. However, I identified another finding that suggests Senshi could possibly be **Janis Jagars**.

In this finding, when I asked ChatGPT about the following, it provided me with the response:

- When we examine the sources below, we can see the individuals who contributed to Mixmaster. Interestingly, on the contribution list, Len Sassaman and Senshi-Admin are listed one after the other.
